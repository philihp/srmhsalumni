      <p>Fellow Alumni, Future Alumni, Friends, and Visitors:</p>
      <p>
        It is a pleasure to welcome you to the Southeast Raleigh Magnet High
        School Alumni Association. I am profoundly honored to serve as the
        President of our SRMHS Alumni Association. I am even more proud to serve
        as President with such a devoted and dedicated Executive Board.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bulldog Alumni family is huge and now it is time to get connected,
        so we can support our school. The mission and commitment of the
        association aims to keep our alumni connected to the school, connected
        to each other, support the students, and to provide essential resources
        to the institution.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Alumni President, it is my goal to work along with the associationâ€™s
        Executive Board to increase membership, raise awareness about the alumni
        association, partner with the community, create a sustainable network
        for all alumni, implement activities and events for alumni, and most
        importantly provide resources for the school through various fundraisers
        and desired programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I encourage each of you to become a member, engage with your fellow
        alumni, stay connected, and get involved. Whether you are near or far,
        there are many ways to give back. Opportunities include career and
        academic mentoring, volunteering at on- and off-campus events,
        supporting and attending academic and social events, and participating
        in our various fundraisers. Joining the Alumni Association provides
        continued success for the students and overall support for Southeast
        Raleigh Magnet High School.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please continue to visit us on the website and our social media for
        information on the Alumni Association, events, donating, and serving.
        Special thanks to each of you for your support!
      </p>
      <p>With warmest regard,</p>
      <p>Tylisa Finley</p>
      <p>President, SRMHS Alumni Association</p>
